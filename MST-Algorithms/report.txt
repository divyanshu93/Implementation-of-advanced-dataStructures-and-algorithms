Prim1, Prim2 and Kruskals MST Algorithm

Using the sp0pq-big.txt as input to the program,we get 9999 as the weight of the MST

There was a huge difference in the running times of Prim1(binary heap), Prim2(indexed heap) and Kruskals.

For Binary Heap the running time(sp0-big.txt) was 3922ms
For Indexed Heap the running time(sp0-big.txt) was 626ms
For Kruskals algorithm the running time(sp0-big.txt) was 3653ms

Thus the Prim2 version is faster than Prim1 and kruskals.
